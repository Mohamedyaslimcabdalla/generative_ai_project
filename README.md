## Introduction

Generative AI has become a key player in various applications, from content creation to data augmentation. This project aims to provide a robust framework that simplifies the development of generative AI applications. With a focus on best practices and modern architecture, this template allows you to focus on building your ideas rather than managing the underlying structure.

## Features

- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to grow with your project needs.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add or remove components as necessary.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides to help you understand and use the template effectively.
- **Pre-built Components**: Includes common functionalities to save you time.
- **Testing Framework**: Integrated testing to ensure reliability.
- **Continuous Integration**: Setup for automated testing and deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with your generative AI project, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Mohamedyaslimcabdalla/generative_ai_project/releases). Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and run the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohamedyaslimcabdalla/generative_ai_project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd generative_ai_project
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use your package manager to install the necessary dependencies. For example, if you are using Python, you might run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Mohamedyaslimcabdalla/generative_ai_project/releases) to download the latest version. Make sure to execute the downloaded file as per the instructions provided.

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the project, you can start building your generative AI application. The main entry point for the application is located in the `main.py` file. You can modify this file to suit your project needs.

### Example Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use the template to generate text using a pre-trained model:

```python
from generative_ai import Model

model = Model.load("path/to/pretrained/model")
output = model.generate("Your prompt here")
print(output)
```

Feel free to explore the `examples` directory for more use cases and examples.
